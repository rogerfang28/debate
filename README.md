Debate — Structured Logical Debate Platform

## What This Is
Debate is a platform for structured, truth-seeking debates between users. Instead of chaotic threads or shouting matches, arguments are built as logical graphs made of claims, supporting evidence, and connections. Users can challenge specific points, prove them wrong, and create sub-debates to resolve disagreements — all transparently and logically.

## Why It Matters
Online debates today:
- Reward loudness instead of accuracy  
- Mix emotional arguments with misinformation  
- Make it hard to understand why something is true or false  

## Debate fixes this by:
- Structuring arguments into clear logical trees  
- Allowing users to challenge specific claims directly  
- Making reasoning transparent and traceable  
- Encouraging collaboration toward truth instead of argument winning  

## Who it’s for:
- Students learning critical thinking  
- Researchers and analysts  
- Educators  
- Anyone who wants debates to actually make people smarter  

## Key Ideas
- Debates as graphs  
- Challenges create sub-debates  
- Claims, proofs, and links  
- Truth-seeking instead of shouting  

## Architecture Overview
Debate is a full-stack platform with a custom logic engine, database layer, and renderer.

## High-level flow:
1. Frontend renders interactive debate graphs  
2. Virtual Renderer determines what the user sees based on engagement state  
3. Backend manages debate logic, validation, and storage  
4. Database stores debates, claims, links, users, and challenges  

More details are available in the docs.

## Author / Why I Built This
I built this project because I believe debates should help people find truth, not just argue louder. This platform is my attempt to design a system where logic wins, reasoning is visible, and discussions genuinely move knowledge forward.
