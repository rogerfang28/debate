DebateTool (placeholder name) — Structured Logical Debate Platform

## What This Is
DebateTool is a work in progress project, a platform for structured debates between users. It is designed with the purpose of representing debates and information, in a way that is easiest to digest and figure out the truth.

## Demo
Example UI:

## The Problem
It's hard to get accurate information with people making many different claims, and it's hard to figure out who is correct, when both sides seem set in stone.
Online debates today may:
- Reward loudness instead of accuracy  
- Mix emotional arguments with misinformation  
- Make it hard to understand why something is true or false: it's hard to figure out the other sides view in comparison to yours

## DebateTool fixes this by:
- Structuring arguments into clear logical trees, allowing for a better representation of both sides 
- Allowing users to challenge specific claims directly, pointing out weak points in the other's debate

## Key Ideas
- Debates as graphs (somewhat like trees, with child claims helping to prove the parent claim)
- Challenges create sub-debates  
- Claims, proofs, and links  
- Truth-seeking instead of shouting  
- New features in the future, ai incorporation, summaries of debates, more limitations to make sure people have to address points made

## Author / Why I Built This
I built this project to solve a real world problem; in politics today, many figures make false claims, take actions to benefit themselves while pretending it benefits everyone, and manipulates a group of people to support them. The goal of this tool is to make it the easiest to see the TRUTH, and hardest for people to spread lies, as the holes in those lies can be pointed out and debunked.
